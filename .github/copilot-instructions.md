# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

This repository stores pre-compiled Native Implemented Functions (NIFs) built with Rust, targeting CentOS 8 on x86_64 architecture. The purpose is to speed up build times by providing ready-to-use compiled binaries.

## Repository Purpose

- Store pre-compiled NIF binaries for Rust projects
- Target platform: CentOS 8 x86_64
- Reduce compilation time in dependent projects

## Guidelines for Contributions

- Ensure all binaries are compiled for the correct target platform (CentOS 8 x86_64)
- Maintain clear documentation for any added binaries
- Follow semantic versioning for binary releases
- Include build metadata (Rust version, compilation flags) when adding new binaries
